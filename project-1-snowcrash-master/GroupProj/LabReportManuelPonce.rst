Basic Board Setup by Manuel Ponce
=================================

When inspecting the Raspberry Pi board, it is clear to see that the board has many connnections. 

Connections::

    The board comes built with and HDMI connection, 4 USB type A ports, an audio connector, a micro SD port, a Ethernet port, and a micro USB port. 

The setup of the board::

    To setup the board, you maust have a Micro-SD card used to store the data and tools youll use on the board. On this it is recomended to download the NOOBS, (New Out Of Box Software), to the SD card. This software includes many operating systems like Raspian, OSMC and Arch Linux. This SD card is also used to upload docker onto it so it can be used on the board. 

    You will need an external power supply to power the board which will be connected by the micro USB port.

    To use the board you will need to connect it to a monitor via the HDMI port and also connect a keyboard and mouse that are compatible with the USB type A connections on the board. 

    Once you have setup the board you will be able to use it and will look like a virtual machine envirement we have been using in class.
