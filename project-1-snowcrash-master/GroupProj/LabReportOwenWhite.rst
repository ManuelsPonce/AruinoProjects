**History of the Raspberry Pi**

The Raspberry Pi Foundation released their first Raspberry Pi unit in 2012. The name was chosen as a combination of nostalgia and tongue-in-cheek description. Many computers of previous eras had been named after fruit; Apple, Blackberry, Apricot, etc. Pi, although seeming to represent the number pi, was actually a reference to the Python programming language.

The Foundation designed the device to create a cheap and easy way for people to get into computing. They were constrained for several years by technology levels, but eventually were able to create a platform that had usable processing power while remaining small and affordable (in the $25-$35 price range). Users have used the Pi to perform tasks such as environmental monitering, driving home-made automated equipment, and assisting with video games.

The Raspberry Pi was extremely popular, selling 4.5 million boards by early 2014. The Foundation continues to release new models. As the progress of technology continues, the boards are getting increasingly more powerful while at the same time becoming smaller and cheaper.
